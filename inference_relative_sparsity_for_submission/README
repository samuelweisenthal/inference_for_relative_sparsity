Code corresponds to inference for relative sparsity

To run a simulated experiment open run.mc.R in Rstudio 
(set debug to 1 to run a small example)

This will generate selection diagrams

To run Monte-Carlo coverage study, open mc.guide.R also in R studio
Some of the path names will be live from run.mc.R

Mimic.R has the steps to run the real data analysis, including generating a calibration curve


major scripts:
sim.db.R simulates data
center.scale.R scales covariates
utils.R helpers
run.one.mc.R  runs on MC for coverage
run.one.select.R runs on MC for selection
grad.R gradients
is.R value estimators
liops.R likelihood
mc.utils.R MC helpers
get.var.R variance estimator
